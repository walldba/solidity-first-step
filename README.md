# Solidity Learning Project

<!-- "# " cria um título de nível 1 -->

This project is a collection of basic Solidity files created to explore and understand core concepts of smart contract development. Each file focuses on a specific topic or feature of the Solidity language.

## File Overview

<!-- "## " cria um título de nível 2 -->

- `1 - variable.sol`: Introduction to variables and data types in Solidity.
- `2 - operators.sol`: Demonstrates arithmetic and logical operators.
- `3 - arrays.sol`: Covers dynamic and fixed-size arrays.
- `4 - mappings.sol`: Introduces key-value storage using mappings.
- `5 - constructors.sol`: Shows how constructors work in contracts.
- `6 - modifiers.sol`: Explains function modifiers and access control.
- `7 - inheritance.sol`: Demonstrates inheritance between contracts.
- `8 - libraries.sol`: Example of using libraries for code reuse.
- `9 - struct.sol`: Defines and uses structs to group related data.
- `10 - store-simulation.sol`: A simple store simulation combining learned concepts.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience with Solidity by building small, focused examples. It is ideal for beginners looking to understand the building blocks of Ethereum smart contracts.
